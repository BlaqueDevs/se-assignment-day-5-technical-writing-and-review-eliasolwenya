Why it's better: "Implement" can be vague. "Use" or "put in place" are more concrete.
Jargon: "Optimize the performance."
Plain Language: "Make it work better" or "Improve the speed."
Why it's better: "Optimize" is a technical term. "Make it work better" is clear and relatable.
Jargon: "Facilitate communication."
Plain Language: "Help people talk to each other."
Why it's better: Much more direct and easier to picture.
Jargon: "Utilize the resource."
Plain Language: "Use the resource."
Why it's better: "Utilize" is just a fancier, unnecessary version of "use."
2. Concepts & Descriptions:

Jargon: "A paradigm shift."
Plain Language: "A major change" or "A new way of thinking."
Why it's better: "Paradigm shift" is overused and often misunderstood.
Jargon: "Leverage the data."
Plain Language: "Use the data" or "Make the most of the data."
Why it's better: "Leverage" is business jargon that can be confusing.
Jargon: "Prioritize the deliverables."
Plain Language: "Focus on the most important tasks."
Why it's better: "Deliverables" and "prioritize" can be replaced with simpler words.
Jargon: "Conduct an assessment."
Plain Language: "Check" or "Review."
Why it's better: "Assessment" sounds formal and complicated.
Jargon: "A robust framework."
Plain Language: "A strong system."
Why it's better: "Robust" and "framework" are needlessly complex.
3. Technical Context (Simplified):

Jargon: "Execute the script."
Plain Language: "Run the program."
Why it's better: While "script" might be necessary in some tech contexts, "run the program" is more accessible to a wider audience.
Jargon: "Decompress the file."
Plain Language: "Unzip the file."
Why it's better: "Unzip" is a widely recognized term.
Jargon: "Establish connectivity."
Plain Language: "Connect."
Why it's better: "Establish connectivity" is overly formal.

## 7. How can using examples and visuals help in explaining complex concepts more clearly?. Enhanced Understanding Through Visual Processing:
